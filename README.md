# riot-web-themes
A place to share themes for [Riot Web](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web). See the [theming documentation](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/blob/master/docs/theming.md) for more information on how these work.

You can use these by editing your `config.json` file to include the theme inside of the `settingDefaults` section like this:

```json
"settingDefaults": {
    "custom_themes": [
        {
            "name": "Example theme",
            "colors": {
                "primary-color": "#9F8652"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Another theme",
            "colors": {
                "primary-color": "#526A9E"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
